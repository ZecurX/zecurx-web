The attached file "INDUSTRIES.pdf" contains a research paper on cybersecurity challenges and ZecurX solutions across five key industries: Enterprise Technology, BFSI, Healthcare, Government/PSU, and Education.[^1]

## Executive Summary

Cloud adoption and digital transformation have created unique cybersecurity needs for each industry, from BFSI compliance to healthcare data protection. ZecurX offers tailored solutions including threat analysis, case studies, and strategic recommendations.[^1]

## Industry Threats

Enterprise Technology faces API attacks and cloud misconfigurations, while BFSI deals with fraud and identity theft. Healthcare contends with PHI theft and ransomware, Government with nation-state threats, and Education with DDoS and data breaches.[^1]

## ZecurX Solutions

Solutions include DevSecOps for tech firms, Zero Trust for BFSI, application hardening for healthcare, cloud architecture for government, and network segmentation for education. Compliance support covers SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and CERT-In.[^1]

## Case Studies

Examples show 40% cloud risk reduction for a SaaS migration, 70% fewer API attacks in BFSI, and full ransomware recovery in education. Each demonstrates measurable outcomes like audit clearance and breach prevention.[^1]

## Value Matrix

A table outlines industry needs, core services (e.g., PenTesting, CIEM), and outcomes like faster releases or DDoS reduction.[^1]
